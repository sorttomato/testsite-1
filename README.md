# testsite
ItÂ´s my first pet-project. Web-page about food.
To use it you must download and install Apache and config httpd.config host

VirtualHost *:80>
     DocumentRoot "/folder/folder/webpage"
     ServerName tnameofthepage.com
</VirtualHost>

And stack. In this project I have used PHP v7.1.33, MySQL, html, css, js. You can find simples in git hub pages: https://github.com/spruzhyna
